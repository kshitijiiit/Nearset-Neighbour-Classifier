Nearset-Neighbour-Classifier
============================

Implement the nearest neighbor classifier


2.py: Randomly partition each dataset into two parts of equal size
      named Training set and Testing set.

3.py: Use the training set as labelled examples in a feature space
      and do nearest neighbor classification of the Testing set samples.

4.py: Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification)
      using the labels of the Test samples and your classifier result.

5.py: Repeat steps 2 - 4 multiple times (at least 10), each time
      dividing the dataset differently. Report the mean and standard
      deviation of the accuracy over the test runs.

6.py: Also report the confusion matrix of each dataset, which depicts
      the classes that are most confused (explanation in class).
